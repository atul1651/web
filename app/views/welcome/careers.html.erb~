<div id="timeline" name="timeline">Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[1] Natura is a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.[2][3] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.[4][5]


Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects – the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness–wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human

The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much more are part of nature. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.

There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of living thing.

From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a constant basis. Every part of nature – everything from the air to the dirt on the ground – is interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.

From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources. People cut down trees to get wood to burn, to build houses, or to make a place to grow food. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.

Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that physics, the study of nature (etymologically), takes.

India Nature Watch, usually referred to as INW, is a non-commercial community website that focuses on sharing photographs of Indian wildlife.[1] The site was started in 2005 by Sudhir Shivaram, Kalyan Varma, Yathin S K and Vijay Cavale.[2]

INW allows uploads into eight categories: Birds, Mammals, Reptiles & Amphibians, Butterflies & Moths, Landscape, Insects & Other Invertebrate, Flora and Others[3] and currently hosts close to 400,000 photographs of Indian wildlife. The copyright of images hosted on the site remains with the photographer, although the site does encourage photographers to release photographs under more liberal licenses like Creative Commons.[4]

The site was started by the moderators of a popular mailing list called india-nature-pixs when Yahoo stopped storing of attachments on its groups service.[citation needed] The aim of the site is to help document and share India's rich but threatened wildlife through the means of photography, with the help of a community of wildlife photographers in India. Photographs posted on the site have uncovered new ranges for species and documentation of rare wildlife,[5][6] though the website has come under fire for being emblematic of an Indian wildlife photography culture that has failed to support conservation efforts in any meaningful way.[7]

INW also maintains a strong neutral and non-conflict culture and discourages posting of controversial photographs. It is believed to be the most popular site in India for wildlife photographs.[7
