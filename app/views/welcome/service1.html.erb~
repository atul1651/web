      <div class="floated-content"><h3>SEO</h3>
<p>
A web page without links is like an uncharted island. It's sitting there, right in the middle of the ocean, but most people don't know it's there. The island could be littered with diamonds. The plants that grow there might heal every disease known to human. None of that matters if no one knows the island is there.</p>
<p>Search engine optimization in a lay man’s language is about trying to rank higher in search engines. To rank higher you make changes to your website that make it easier for search engines to understand your content. Also, it can mean getting links from other websites. It is indeed sounding very easy than it is in reality. </p>
<p>In this digital world there is a rat race amongst the increasing brands as each one has high expectations from SEO, everyone looks for page 1 rankings for their website. The client gets up and says “I want to be ranked by tomorrow." </p>
<p>The reality is that getting results from SEO for new brands is - in view of competition and in view of the increasingly strict guidelines of Google - somewhat tricky. We recommend doing SEO for minimum 3 to 6 months before seeing the impact. And we also recommend that one should not be totally dependent on SEO, other digital marketing activities should be done in parallel. After all slow n Steady wins the SEO race.</p> 
<p>We at Digimerc have a strong believe that the success of the page should be measured by one criteria: Does the visitor do what you want them to do? </p>

<p>The biggest difference to SEO these days is now it's more valuable to remove links rather than build them. What exclusive SEO service we offer for you?</p>
